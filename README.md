# haskell-advent-of-code

Solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) set of programming puzzles in Haskell.

Also my first attempt at Haskell and functional programming.

Write-ups for each problem to be added soon!

## Usage

Run `make` to compile binaries for each solution, or just run them from
source with `runhaskell`.

Most of the solutions take a single command line argument in the form of a path
to the problem input, although some take the problem parameters directly. Running
any solution without arguments will display a simple usage guide.
