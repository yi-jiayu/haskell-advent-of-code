# haskell-advent-of-code

Solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) set of programming puzzles in Haskell. 

Also my first attempt at Haskell and functional programming.

Write-ups for each problem to be added soon!

## Usage

I'm not really sure this is considered usage, but you can build my solutions using the Makefile or run them with `runhaskell`. 
In the beginning I was still getting to know the language and didn't know how to display command line flags so running the 
examples may be a little confusing. Most of the examples take a single argument to a file containing the input from the 
Advent of Code website, but some of the problems which have shorter or simpler inputs take them directly as command line
arguments.
